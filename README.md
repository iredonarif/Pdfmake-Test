# PdfMake package test with React

The goal is to learn how to use pdfmake package with react.

## Overview

In this project we retrieve data (a company employees list) from a json file and display it in a downloadable pdf document.

First, the list of employees is displayed in an html table. Above this table, there is a button (Export to PDF); when this button is clicked, the pdf document is generated.

## Content

Different elements that are used in this small project are:

* Add Paragraph
* Add Title
* Create table
* Insert table columns
* Styling
* Insert Image
* Download pdf document

## Note
- The json file is saved in the project.
